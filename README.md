# Use-Flicker-API-data-and-use-it-with-PHP-

you will retrieve photos from Flickr and you will display them on your page by connecting to Flickr API from PHP. You can search for pictures for any set of keywords, but make sure you put those keywords on top of the page.
You will display 100 thumbnail images on your result page. Once clicked on the image, it will show the photo in its original size. Photos will be ordered based on the date they were taken (descending order).
